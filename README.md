# Movies-ETL
Amazing prime would like to set up a hackathon on data gathered about movies from wikipaedia and kaggle. Data from wikipaedia is scoured and returned as a JSON file, however the data is messy and inconsistent. Using pandas in python, the JSON was read, cleaned up and entered into a data frame. Data from kaggle for movie ratings and movie metadata was received as a csv file, which was read into data frames and cleaned up, although it was relatively clean to begin with. Ones the data was combined to fill in missing data, and cleaned up and formatted, it was pushed into a postgreSQL database.
